Hello world
-----------

This is the basic "hello world" example.

        ( 'hello world' delog .)

The output is similar to:

        ::::			[11f:STRING "hello world"]
        0000	r->value	[244:CLOSURE]

Sorry about only having debug logging output. Technically

        'hello world'

would do, but hey.
