After a git related screw-up resulting in the loss of local commit history,
I decided it was a good idea to have a blog.
I am going to use this blog to talk about past, present and future of
the Nominine programming language and go into detail on issues, features and problems I find interesting.

This reminds me that there are new features in Nominine:

- Strings now have 'merge' and 'join' methods.
- There is basic console IO.
- Dependent typing, in the form of something I call a "category".
- Multiple parameters have been completely redone and are now very easy and straight forward.
- User-defined types with easy to do constructors.
- Polymorphism everywhere.
- Everything with a 'to-string' method that creates a string is a string.

The documentation is updated to reflect these changes.
